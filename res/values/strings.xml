            Whose woods these are I think I know.
			His house is in the village, though.
			He will not see me stopping here
			To watch his woods fill up with snow.
			
			My little horse must think it queer
			To stop without a farmhouse near
			Between the woods and frozen lake
			The darkest evening of the year.
			
			He gives his harness bells a shake
			To ask if there is some mistake.
			The only other sound\'s the sweep
			Of easy wind and downy flake.
			
			The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
			But I have promises to keep,
			And miles to go before I sleep,
			And miles to go before I sleep.
